# Tic-Tac-Toe

This game is a work-in-progress. Eventually you will 
be able to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer, or 
possibly another person, via a web application.

In order to make (reasonable-moves run) faster we need to write the following
functions:

(remaining-combinations board move)

(combo-value board combo) 
combo-value decides wether a specific move could result in a definite win or probably win.
Either decision would be based boolean style. 

(hightest-combo-value board move)

We also need to test best-move.
